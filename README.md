<p>Data sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?resource=download</p>

Road accidents data in the US from 2016 - 2023

after downloading the Data from the link provided, I analysed it and cleaned it by dropping any collumns I did not intend on using and replacing NaN values if necessary. I then created a new cleaned file with the updated data to be used for my project.

- I Will documennt this project split into 5 main notebooks. Data exploration, Data cleaning, Data visualisation, machine learning and dinal analysis.

- My goal for this project is to practise what I have learned after completing the python for data science course on IBM Skillsbuild, while trying out some new libraries and learning more as I go along.

After Completing this project I hope to be comfortable using Python effeciently and expand my coding knowledge.

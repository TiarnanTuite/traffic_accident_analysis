## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts the **severity of road accidents in the U.S.** between 2016 and 2023.  
The dataset contains millions of accident records, and the goal is to understand contributing factors and predict how severe an accident might be under given conditions.

The work is divided into **five Jupyter notebooks**:

1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Understanding dataset structure and distributions
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Removing irrelevant columns, handling missing data, and exporting a cleaned version
3. **Data Visualization** â€“ Creating bar charts, severity plots, and interactive Folium heatmaps (with user input by state)
4. **Machine Learning** â€“ Training multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) to predict accident severity
5. **Final Analysis** â€“ Loading the final weighted XGBoost model, testing predictions, and preparing for deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Apply and expand on concepts learned in the **IBM Python for Data Science** course
- Build confidence using real-world datasets and industry-standard Python libraries
- Practice **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning**, and **visual storytelling**
- Create a web application where users can enter conditions and receive a predicted accident severity level
